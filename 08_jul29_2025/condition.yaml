# Notes on parameter selection for mm-scale microstructure:
# - Your cells are ~1mm in size (0.001m), which is quite large
# - This represents a very coarse-grained material
# - Mobility is reduced compared to μm-scale to account for size
# - Simulation time is increased to allow for evolution
# - Save interval is reasonable for 10×10×10 grid
